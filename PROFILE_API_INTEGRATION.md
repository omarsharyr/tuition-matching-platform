## Data Integration Features

### Cross-Model Synchronization

- Name changes update both User.name and firstName/lastName fields

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing user data preserved during model enhancement
- Graceful fallbacks for missing profile data
- Auto-migration of existing name fields to new structure

### Search and Performance
- Geospatial indexing for location-based searches
- Performance indexes on frequently queried fields
- Optimized aggregation queries for profile data

## File Upload Integration

### Image Upload Support
**Middleware:** `middleware/uploadMiddleware.js`
**Storage:** Cloudinary integration with local fallback
**Validation:** Image type and size validation (5MB limit)
**Processing:** Automatic filename sanitization and timestamping

### Upload Endpoints
- Profile image upload for both students and tutors
- Document upload support for verification
- Portfolio file management for tutors

## Authentication & Security

### Route Protection
- All profile endpoints require authentication (`protect` middleware)
- Role-based access control (`requireRole` middleware)
- Some endpoints require verification (`requireVerified` middleware)

### Data Validation
- Comprehensive input validation on all profile updates
- Type checking and format validation
- Sanitization of user input data

## Frontend Integration Points

**Response Format:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  profile: {

## API Usage Examples

### Getting a Profile
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/students/profile', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const { profile } = await response.json();
```

### Updating a Profile
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/students/profile', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    bio: 'Updated bio'
  })
});
```

### Uploading Profile Image
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', imageFile);

const response = await fetch('/api/students/profile/image', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: formData
});
```

This comprehensive backend API integration provides full support for the frontend profile systems with professional-grade features and robust data management.
