## üéØ Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Better Code Review**: Each commit focuses on one feature area
2. **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific features  
3. **Selective Rollback**: Can revert specific features without affecting others
4. **Clear Progress Tracking**: Team can see feature development progress
5. **Better Documentation**: Each commit documents a specific feature
6. **Easier Testing**: Features can be tested individually
7. **Improved Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features

## üìù For Future Development:
Always create small, focused commits that:
- Address one specific feature or fix
- Include clear commit messages with conventional format
- Have comprehensive descriptions in commit body
- Reference issues or requirements when applicable
- Include any breaking changes in footer
